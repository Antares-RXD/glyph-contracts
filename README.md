**Disclaimer:** This Github is **NOT** responsible for the creation, origin, use of the embedded contracts. 

## Conditions for adding contracts

The Radiant network is free and unrestricted, but adding a token contract to this list has conditions:

No name or image allowed:
- NSFW.
- Racism.
- Violence.
- Duplicate names (the date of the contract decides who will be on the list).

These conditions will be updated as we review the embedded tokens.
